# Beginning-projects

This repository consists of early projects I made on my journey to learning Python. None of it will be skilled. Its mostly tutorials from a video or projects that I made on my own, for fun. Feel free to use literally anything from it. 

The video I used for learning Python: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc by "Programming with Mosh".
